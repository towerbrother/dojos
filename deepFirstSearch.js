Problem Description

Depth-first search is not just an AI technique it is also the standard way that trees (ubiquitous in computer science) are traversed.

Clues

For this (easiest) form of depth-first search, steer towards using the function-call stack, rather than a stack data structure.

Try to avoid implementing a Graph or Maze or Problem class (even as a mocked interface) for your depth-first-searcher to traverse. 
Instead, ask questions of a “human” user (e.g. standard in/standard out or whatever your language uses).
For example, “What are the exits?” and “Where are we?”. This allows exploratory testing, which is fun. 
Having to build a Graph or Maze by initializing data, or parsing a file, slows down the group and is distant from the main thrust of the kata.

Of course, you should mock the conversation in your unit tests! 
This demonstrates that exploratory testing can be recorded in repeatable automated tests, which is valuable.
